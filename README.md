# StarterPack
StarterPack is a combination of files and folders, packed together, to get you starting a new web project ASAP.

It has all you need for creating efficient projects on large professional scale, to small web projects.

I've created it to automatize the process of starting each **new, purely custom, web development project**. Without having to use parts of *Boostrap* in order to speed it up, or to *copy-paste or re-create grid, mixins, functions from previous projects*.
