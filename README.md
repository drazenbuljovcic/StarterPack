# StarterPack
StarterPack is a setup for **starting each new, efficient, custom web projects**.

Packing grid, very useful mixins, color palette map and function, few, most useful js plugins, and more.

All for: **157kb** *(without Google font and images).*

In general, this setup, is all you need for 85% of web projects.
And you **create solid web site, under 500kb**, with awesomely documented, and efficient code.

Start of your custom new web project in few seconds, from ground up, with great setup from large scale projects, to small web projects.
All with **best practice** mixins, functions, grid, media query breakpoints, and more.

I've created it to automatize the process of starting each **new, purely custom, web development project**. Without having to use parts of *Boostrap* in order to speed it up, or to *copy-paste or re-create grid, mixins, functions from previous projects*.
