# StarterPack
StarterPack is setup for **new efficient custom web projects**.
Packing grid, media mixins, color palette map and function, few, most useful js plugins, all for: **157kb** *(without Google font and images).

Start of your custom new web project in few seconds, from ground up, with great setup from large scale projects, to small web projects.
All with **best practice** mixins, functions, grid, media query breakpoints, and more.

I've created it to automatize the process of starting each **new, purely custom, web development project**. Without having to use parts of *Boostrap* in order to speed it up, or to *copy-paste or re-create grid, mixins, functions from previous projects*.
