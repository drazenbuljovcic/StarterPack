# StarterPack
StarterPack is a setup for **starting each new, efficient, custom web project**.

Packing **best practice** grid, very useful mixins, color palette map and function, few, most useful js plugins, and more.

All for: **157kb** *(without Google font and images).*

In general, this setup, is *all you need for 85% of web projects*.

Easily **create solid website, under 500kb in total**,  with awesomely documented, and efficient code.

Start of your custom new web project in few seconds, from ground up, with great setup from large scale projects, to small web projects.

I've created it to automatize the process of starting each **new, purely custom, web development project**. Without having to use parts of *Boostrap* in order to speed it up, or to *copy-paste or re-create grid, mixins, functions from previous projects*.
